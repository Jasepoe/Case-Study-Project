# Case-Study-Project strategies 

From the perspective of a consultant data analyst at Lariat, a fictional rental car company, I am entrusted to analyze a large data set and define high level business objectives including minimizing costs and maximizing revenue. Here I am to showcase my data analysis, bussiness knowledge and modeling skills.

My job is to derive insights from this data to achieve these goals. Within the excel file, I have derived key insights and modeled 3 strategies to achieve the company's goal of minimizing cost and maximizing revenue. 

I also included an interactive Dashboard to show more specific relevant data per car model selected. 

Finally, my project includes a set of clear and precise slides that I can use as my visual if I need to present my findings in front of clients or stakeholders
