My goal with this project: 
To show proficiency in deriving business insights from data with minimal guidance. 
Proficiency in transforming data using Excel. 
Creating presentations and visuals with PowerPoint Slides.

In this project, I am working from the perspective of a data analyst working with a rental car company. The project is very open ended without much guidance. The executives at the Lariat rental car company have defined the following business objective: 

minimize costs and maximize revenue. 

If this were an actual project for a company, I would be sure to ask clarifying questions with management to ensure we are all on the same page as far as expectations. I would be sure to understand deadlines and to confirm the limits of the project. Last, I would make sure who to reach out to if I were to find any problems in the datasets that would not allow for me to conduct an accurate analysis. 

As I only have information on this one business objective of minimizing cost and maximizing revenue, I followed my process of compiling all the data into one spreadsheet. I then ensured my data is valid, relevant, and without any missing items or formatting mistakes. After reviewing the cleaned datasets, I derived 3 strategies to help the rental car company reach there business objective

My final reports consisted of:

An excel model showing those 3 business recommendations. This model is located on the first sheet of my excel file. 

An interactive dashboard where interested parties can select different car models to see operating cost and revenue for those particular models. 

Last, I included PowerPoint slides to use as a visual when presenting my findings. The slides are minimal in wording and design. This is for management or clients, so they can easily see just the information they need to guide there business plans. If needed I would be able to give an in depth explanation of my analysis to my team or management. 

Skills utilized in this project include: 

Preparation: Understanding expectations and compiling various datasets into one spreadsheet

Data cleaning: Using sort and filter techniques as well as conditional formatting to check for missing data, errors, duplicates, outliers, and inconsistencies in the formatting

Analysis: using knowledge of advanced excel techniques including formulas, pivot tables, VLOOKUP, and modeling to transform the datasets and achieve the objective

Interactive Dashboard: built an operational dashboard where users can select certain car models to see relevant data points. This dashboard would stay operational even if new sales data were constantly coming in and updating. I added protection measures to the dashboard to prevent any mistakes from the end user that would cause the dashboard to not operate as expected. 

Creative Solutions: Beyond the technical abilities to operate Excel and other analytic tools, Data Analysts will use a creative side combined with knowledge of business to derive insights from data. I believe I have achieved this with my project. 

Visualization: The excel model shows various charts and graphs that help plot out interesting findings with the data. These charts help easily see key information derived from the data. These charts were included in my slide deck. 

Thank you,
